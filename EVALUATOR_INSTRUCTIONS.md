   python -m uvicorn app.api:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

2. **Open your browser and go to:**
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8000
   ```

3. **Look for completed workflows** in the dashboard
4. **Click "📋 FULL BRIEF CONTENT"** to see the complete assignment
5. **Or click "🌐 Web View"** for a formatted HTML version

### ✅ Method 2: Generate a New Brief (If needed)

1. **Use the FastAPI docs interface:**
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
   ```

2. **Find the POST /brief endpoint** and click "Try it out"

3. **Use this sample request:**
   ```json
   {
     "user_id": "evaluator_test",
     "topic": "Impact of AI tutoring systems on personalized learning outcomes in K-12 education",
     "depth": 3,
     "follow_up": false,
     "context": "Focus on classroom applications and student learning effectiveness"
   }
   ```

4. **Wait 1-2 minutes for completion**
5. **View the result using the workflow ID provided**
